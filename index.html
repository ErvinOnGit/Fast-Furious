    <h1><strong>THE CARS OF FAST & FURIOUS</strong></h1> 
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Fast & Furious</strong> is an American action media franchise centered on street racing, heists, and spies. Distributed by Universal Pictures, it includes films, short films, a TV series, and theme park attractions.</p>

<p>The series started in 2001, based on the article "Racer X." While the first four films focused on illegal racing, Fast Five (2011) shifted the genre toward heists and espionage. The main series is expected to conclude with Fast Forever in 2028.</p>

<p>The franchise has expanded to include the spin-off Hobbs & Shaw> and the animated series Spy Racers. Further projects are currently in development.</p>

<p>With a total gross of over $7 billion, it is the eighth highest-grossing film series of all time. While critical reviews vary, the middle entries of the franchise are the most highly rated.</p>

      <ul style="display: table; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left;">
<li>
<strong>1963 CHEVY CORVETTE GRAND SPORT</strong>
<p>Featured in the opening train heist of <em>Fast Five</em>, this roofless powerhouse is famously driven off a moving train and over a cliff by Dom and Brian. Only a handful of these grand-sport replicas were built for the movie, designed for high-speed off-road stunts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>1966 FORD GT40</strong>
<p>This legendary racing icon serves as the "macguffin" in <em>Fast Five</em>. While it is a beautiful piece of automotive history, its importance in the film lies in a hidden computer chip containing the locations of Hernan Reyes' $100 million cash vaults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>1967 FORD MUSTANG</strong>
<p>The "Frankenstein" hero car from <em>Tokyo Drift</em>. To compete in the final mountain race, Sean Boswell and his crew swap the engine from Han’s wrecked Nissan Silvia (an RB26DETT) into this classic American shell, creating a unique cross-cultural drift machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>1969 CHEVROLET YENKO CAMARO</strong>
<p>Brian wins this classic muscle car during a high-stakes "pink slip" race in <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em>. It is most famous for the film's climax, where Brian jumps the car off a ramp and onto a moving yacht to take down the villain, Carter Verone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>1970 CHEVROLET CHEVELLE SS</strong>
<p>Initially seen in red at the end of the first film, this car returns in a primer-grey "street fighter" look in <em>Fast & Furious (4)</em>. Dom uses its massive torque and heavy frame to smash through obstacles during the tunnel chase sequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>DODGE CHARGER DAYTONA</strong>
<p>Appearing in <em>Fast & Furious 6</em>, this version of the famous NASCAR aero-car was modified with a slightly shorter nose and a lowered rear wing to make it more practical for street racing and stunt work in London.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>DODGE CHARGER R/T</strong>
<p>The most iconic car in the franchise, this 1970 Charger is Dom’s signature ride. Built by his father, it is known for its massive BDS supercharger and the terrifying wheelie it pulls during the final drag race against Brian’s Supra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>FLIP CAR</strong>
<p>A custom-built, low-profile ramp vehicle driven by the villains in <em>Fast & Furious 6</em>. Its wedge-shaped design and four-wheel steering allow it to drive head-on into oncoming police cars, launching them into the air like toys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>HONDA S2000</strong>
<p>A staple of the early films, most notably Johnny Tran’s black version in the first movie and Suki’s hot-pink, nitrous-boosted version in <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em>, which successfully cleared a massive bridge jump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>LEXUS LFA</strong>
<p>This high-tech V10 supercar appears at the end of <em>Fast Five</em>. After the successful Rio heist, Han is seen driving this ultra-rare machine along the German Autobahn with Gisele as they head toward Berlin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE</strong>
<p>Brian O’Conner’s first undercover car from the original film. Despite its neon lights and "danger to intake manifold" warning, it remains a fan favorite as the car that introduced Brian to the world of underground street racing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>NISSAN 350Z ‘FAIRLADY’</strong>
<p>The primary antagonist car in <em>Tokyo Drift</em>, driven by Takashi (DK). It features a distinctive matte-black and charcoal "beetle" livery and was specifically tuned for precision drifting in tight parking garages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>NISSAN SILVIA S15</strong>
<p>Referred to as the "Mona Lisa" of the drift world by Han. It was a beautifully tuned machine that was unfortunately destroyed in Sean’s very first attempt at drifting in Tokyo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>NISSAN SKYLINE R34 GT-R</strong>
<p>The definitive Brian O'Conner car. Whether it's the silver and blue version from <em>2 Fast</em> or the clean Bayside Blue model from the fourth film, the R34 represents the "Godzilla" of the JDM scene and Brian’s personal favorite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>TOYOTA SUPRA</strong>
<p>The orange MKIV Supra from the first film is the "ten-second car" that Brian and Dom built from a junk heap. It became a global symbol for the tuner movement and served as the emotional centerpiece of Paul Walker’s final scene in <em>Furious 7</em>.</p>
